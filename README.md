# ðŸŽ® Steam Price Watcher

A Python script that automatically checks the price of games on the Steam store and sends an email notification if the price drops below a user-defined target.

Perfect for users who want to track deals without manually checking the store. It can be run daily via GitHub Actions or a local scheduler like `cron`.
